We know that before the new strategy, the total revenue was $100. Based on the number of copies sold at the price of the old strategy: np = $100.\r\n3.	We know that with the new strategy, the total revenue was $100. Based on 10 more copies sold and a $5 reduction in the price per unit: (n+10)(p-$5) = $100.\r\n4.	Expand this second equation: np - 5n + 10p - 50 = 100.\r\n5.	From the first equation, we know that np = $100, so plug that in for np: 100 - 5n + 10p - 50 = 100.\r\n6.	From the first equation, if we divide by n, we end up with p = $100/n. Plug this value in for p:\r\n100 - 5n + 10(100/n) - 50 = 100.\r\n7.	Combine like terms: 50 - 5n + 1000/n = 100.\r\n8.

(100, '<p>Springfield Fire Commissioner: The vast majority of false fire alarms are prank<br />\r\ncalls made anonymously from fire alarm boxes on street corners. Since virtually<br />\r\neveryone has access to a private telephone, these alarm boxes have outlived their<br />\r\nusefulness. Therefore, we propose to remove the boxes. Removing the boxes will<br />\r\nreduce the number of prank calls without hampering people&rsquo;s ability to report a<br />\r\nfire.<br />\r\nWhich of the following, if true, most strongly supports the claim that the proposal,<br />\r\nif carried out, will have the announced effect?</p>\r\n', '(A) The fire department traces all alarm calls made from private telephones and records where they came from. ', '(B) Maintaining the fire alarm boxes costs Springfield approximately $5 million annually. ', '(C) A telephone call can provide the fire department with more information about the nature and size of a fire than can an alarm placed from an alarm box. ', '(D) Responding to false alarms significantly reduces the fire departmentâ€™s capacity for responding to fires. ', '(E) On any given day, a significant percentage of the public telephones in Springfield are out of service.', 1, 'A Correct. This option provides the most support for the claim.\r\nB This may provide a reason for supporting the proposal, but it provides no\r\nsupport for either (1) or (2).\r\nC This indicates that it is better to receive fire calls from telephones than\r\nfrom alarm boxesâ€”other things being equalâ€”but that supports neither (1)\r\nnor (2). There is still the possibility that the only person aware that a fire\r\nhas started is near an alarm box but lacks access to a telephone.\r\nD This merely indicates that it would be good if the proposal had the\r\nintended effects.\r\nE This actually weakens support for (2), by enhancing the possibility that\r\nthe only person aware that a fire has started is near an alarm box but lacks\r\naccess to a working telephone.\r\nThe correct answer is A.', '2', 'English', 1, 'yes', '2017-06-16', '0000-00-00', '');
